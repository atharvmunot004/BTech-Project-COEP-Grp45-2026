Here is a detailed methodology for implementing a **Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) for Scenario Generation in Risk Assessment** within your hedge fund framework — including inputs, how to obtain them, and why this tool makes sense from recent literature.

## 1. Concept & Use-Case

**Purpose:**
Use a QGAN to generate *synthetic scenario paths* (for asset returns, tail-loss events, risk factor movements) that can feed into your risk/optimizer pipeline. This helps overcome data-scarcity (especially of extreme events), enrich the scenario set for VaR/CVaR/portfolio optimization modules, and provide a quantum-augmented complement to classical scenario generators.

In your hedge-fund stack, this tool would:

* Supply scenario inputs (extreme, rare, stress states) for your risk tools (VaR, CVaR, Monte Carlo, EVT)
* Be another “tool” your LLM agent can **choose** when it deems classical scenarios insufficient (e.g., rare regime, high-vol event)
* Enable comparative research: classical GANs vs quantum-GANs vs parametric vs Monte-Carlo scenario generation → measure downstream portfolio/risk impact.

**Key Derived Variables / Preparations:**

* Normalize or standardize historical returns (zero mean, unit var) to feed into generator/discriminator.
* Feature-engineer temporal structure (lags, volatility clustering, regime switches) so the generator can replicate stylized facts (autocorrelation, heavy tails, skewness).
* Split data into *training window* (most history) and *test window* (for scenario‐validation).
* Possibly define a **threshold** for tail events (to condition generation on rare events).
* Encode the quantum generator: define qubit mapping of latent to output time-series vectors — e.g., amplitude encoding or variational circuit output measurement → mapped to scenario vector.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Data preparation

* Gather historical returns/risk-factor changes for the set of assets/factors you're concerned with.
* Preprocess: remove outliers, standardize, optionally filter by regime.
* Create sliding windows of length ( H ) (if generating H-step scenario paths).
* Optionally label each window with regime state (bull, bear, neutral) for conditional generation.

### Step 2: Classical benchmark GAN

* Before quantum, build a classical GAN (generator + discriminator) to generate scenario paths — this gives baseline.
* Train until generator produces realistic multi-step paths: check distributions, correlations, tail statistics.

### Step 3: Define quantum generator architecture

* Choose number of qubits $$( n_q )$$ such that latent + output mapping is feasible (e.g., 4–10 qubits initially).
* Design variational circuit (parameterised rotations + entanglement layers) that outputs measurement results mapped to scenario vector $$( s \in \mathbb R^H \times N )$$
* Optionally integrate a classical discriminator or hybrid quantum discriminator.

### Step 4: Training loop

* For each batch:

  * Sample latent vector ( z ) (quantum state prep).
  * Generate scenario $$( s_{\text{gen}} )$$
  * Sample real scenario $$( s_{\text{real}} )$$ from historical windows.
  * Discriminator learns to distinguish; generator learns to fool.
  * Loss functions: standard GAN loss, plus additional constraints/metrics: tail-event matching, distribution divergence (e.g., Wasserstein distance).
* Use hybrid optimisation (classical optimiser over quantum circuit parameters).
* Track metrics: similarity of distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, tail event frequency), temporal correlations (autocorr), cross-asset correlations.

### Step 5: Scenario generation and integration

* Once trained, generate many scenario paths (e.g., 10,000 or more).
* Map them into your risk/portfolio pipeline: feed scenario returns into VaR/CVaR, portfolio optimizer to test performance under those synthetic scenarios.
* Log scenario metadata (seed, circuit parameters, conditioning variables) for reproducibility.

### Step 6: Validation & backtesting

* Compare generated scenario sets vs historical hold-out set:

  * Distribution match: means, volatilities, skewness, kurtosis.
  * Tail event frequency: Does generator produce extreme losses at rates consistent with history or higher (for stress)?
  * Correlation structure: cross-asset, lagged auto-correlations.
* Perform downstream test: use scenarios in portfolio optimisation & risk tools; evaluate whether synthetic data improves robustness (e.g., more conservative weights, fewer tail events).
* Document results in MLflow: metrics, hyper-parameters, scenario quality scores.

### Step 7: Logging & integration into agentic architecture

* Wrap the QGAN scenario generator as a **tool** in your agentic system: input = conditioning variables/regime + latent seed; output = scenario batch.
* Label the tool: “QGAN Scenario Generator”.
* The agent (LLM orchestrator) can call this tool when regime indicates data scarcity or high tail risk.
* Log: which tool used, which scenario set fed, downstream risk/portfolio outcome.

## 4. Why This Tool is a Sound Choice (with Recent Literature)

### Rationale for scenario-generation GANs

* Real financial data are limited, especially extreme events; classical scenario generators often rely on parametric models or simplistic Monte Carlo that fail to capture complex dependence and rare‐event structure.
* GANs (generative adversarial networks) can learn the joint distribution of multivariate time-series and generate synthetic scenarios without strong parametric assumptions.

  * Example: Flaig & Junike (2021) show GAN-based economic scenario generation for market risk modelling: “Scenario generation for market risk models using generative neural networks”. ([arXiv][1])
  * Example: Rizzato et al. (2022/23) demonstrate conditional GANs for synthetic financial scenario generation. ([ressources-actuarielles.net][2])

### Extension to quantum domain: QGAN / QWGAN

* The quantum version (QGAN or Quantum Wasserstein GAN) aims to exploit quantum circuit expressive power (entanglement, superposition) to model complex distributions with fewer parameters.

  * Orlandi, Barbierato & Gatti (2024) present “Enhancing Financial Time Series Prediction with Quantum-Enhanced Synthetic Data Generation: A Case Study on the S&P 500 Using a Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Approach”. ([MDPI][3])
* The recent preprint “Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations” (Dechant et al., 2025) explores how QGANs can generate time-series with desired temporal correlation and tail structure. ([arXiv][4])

### Why this fits a hedge fund risk-module

* The tool helps **stress test** portfolios by generating hypothetical but plausible extreme scenarios that may not have historical precedent.
* It integrates naturally into tail-risk assessments: by feeding into your VaR/CVaR/portfolio modules under new scenario sets, you can test robustness under synthetic stress.
* It supports your comparative-study objective: you can compare classical scenario generation vs QGAN-based scenario generation and measure downstream effects (risk estimates, portfolio performance, tool selection by agent).
* It meets the quantum-hybrid narrative: QGAN is one of the quantum modules your system will evaluate, offering a quantum-classical research frontier.

## 5. Research / Extension Directions

* **Conditional QGAN**: condition synthetic scenario generation on regime indicators (bull/bear/neutral), macro variables, or volatility state to produce regime-specific scenario sets.
* **Tail-enhanced sampling**: oversample extreme outcomes in latent space (e.g., bias generator to produce more tail events) to ensure synthetic dataset has richer stress states than history.
* **Quantum advantage assessment**: compare scenario generation efficiency/quality (e.g., fewer parameters, faster training, better tail fidelity) of QGAN vs classical GAN under asset/universe sizes relevant to your fund.
* **Integration with downstream risk tools**: assess not only scenario fidelity, but *portfolio/risk outcome impact* of scenarios (i.e., does synthetic data lead to materially different risk estimates or allocation decisions?).
* **Hybrid classical-quantum pipeline**: classical discriminator + quantum generator or vice-versa; also explore quantum discriminator.
