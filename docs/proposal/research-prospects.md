# Research Prospects

## 1️. Quantum vs Classical Risk Assessment

**Core question:**
Can quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) or quantum Monte Carlo estimate portfolio tail risk (VaR / CVaR) faster or more accurately than classical simulation?

**Possible studies**

* Benchmark QAE against classical Monte Carlo for VaR and CVaR on multi-asset portfolios.
* Measure empirical error vs. sample size → show (O(1/N)) vs (O(1/\sqrt{N})) scaling.
* Hybrid workflow: classical scenario generator + QAE evaluation.

**Data / experiments**

* Historical equity indices or ETF baskets (S&P 500, NIFTY 50).
* Compare classical 10⁵–10⁶ samples to quantum-simulated QAE on 8–12 qubits (Qiskit Aer).

**Publishable in**

* *Quantum Information Processing (Springer)*
* *Frontiers in Physics – Quantum Engineering*
* *Journal of Risk and Financial Management* (for finance-leaning audiences)



## 2️. Quantum-Enhanced Portfolio Optimization

**Core question:**
Does Quantum Mean–Variance (QMV) or QAOA for CVaR achieve better solution quality or runtime for constrained portfolios?

**Possible studies**

* Encode Markowitz and CVaR optimization as QUBO problems; solve via D-Wave annealer or QAOA.
* Evaluate scalability with number of assets N = 10–50.
* Compare Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and solution sparsity against classical solvers (quadratic programming, DRO).

**Data / experiments**

* Daily returns of S&P sector ETFs or cryptocurrency baskets.
* Simulated quantum runs + classical baseline (IBM Qiskit Runtime).

**Publishable in**

* *IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering*
* *Journal of Computational Finance*
* *Quantum Machine Intelligence (Springer)*



## 3️. Regime-Adaptive Quantum Trading

**Core question:**
Can a quantum regime detector (QBM or qPCA) improve trading strategy selection and risk-adjusted return?

**Possible studies**

* Build hybrid pipeline:
  regime detector (QBM / qPCA) → strategy selector (momentum / mean-reversion / pairs) → QMV optimizer.
* Compare performance to fixed-strategy baselines using Sharpe, Sortino, and maximum drawdown.
* Study regime transition probabilities and stability.

**Data / experiments**

* Multi-decade equity index and volatility indices (VIX, MOVE).
* Rolling-window training + backtest.

**Publishable in**

* *Quantitative Finance*
* *Physica A – Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*
* *Quantum Machine Learning (Springer)*



## 4️. Quantum Generative Models for Scenario Simulation

**Core question:**
Can QGAN / QBM generate realistic market return distributions beyond Gaussian/t models?

**Possible studies**

* Train QGAN on daily returns; compare generated distributions (skewness, kurtosis, tail behavior) to real data.
* Use generated scenarios to stress-test classical optimizers.
* Evaluate sample diversity vs. model capacity.

**Data / experiments**

* Equity + crypto returns (diverse non-Gaussian behaviors).
* Use Qiskit Machine Learning or Pennylane QGAN.

**Publishable in**

* *Entropy (MDPI)*
* *npj Quantum Information* (for algorithmic focus)
* *Journal of Computational Science*



## 5️. Quantum Reinforcement Learning in Trading

**Core question:**
Does quantum policy search (QRL) improve learning speed or stability for trading agents?

**Possible studies**

* Implement classical DQN / PPO vs Quantum Variational RL.
* Compare convergence rate and reward volatility under identical environments.
* Test on discrete trading actions (buy, sell, hold) with transaction costs.

**Data / experiments**

* High-frequency or daily price data; environment via OpenAI Gym / FinRL.

**Publishable in**

* *IEEE Access (Quantum Computing special issues)*
* *Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence – AI in Finance*



## 6️. Comparative Framework Paper

**Core question:**
How do quantum and classical methods interact across the entire hedge-fund pipeline?

**Possible studies**

* Integrate modules from above (risk, optimization, regime detection, trading).
* Quantify computational complexity, scalability, and potential speed-ups.
* Provide taxonomy + performance dashboard.

**Publishable in**

* *ACM Computing Surveys (if broad)*
* *Quantum Reports*
* *Springer Handbook of Computational Finance* (as a chapter)
