# **Project Proposal: Comparative Analysis of Quantum–Classical Hybrid Hedge Fund Architectures**

## **1. Overview**

This project aims to design, implement, and evaluate a **quantum–classical hybrid hedge fund framework** where different algorithmic tools — both classical and quantum — are tested under diverse market regimes.
The core idea is to identify **which risk, optimization, and forecasting tools perform best under specific market conditions** and **how large language models (LLMs) select and combine these tools** when acting as the system’s agentic decision-makers.

Ultimately, this will lead to:

* A **comparative dataset** linking market conditions ↔ tool performance ↔ LLM decision logic.
* A **research benchmark** for hybrid quant systems integrating AI and quantum computation in real financial decision loops.

## **2. Objectives**

1. **Comparative study of tools:**
   Evaluate multiple *risk assessment*, *portfolio optimization*, and *strategy selection* algorithms — both classical and quantum — across different historical and simulated market regimes.

2. **LLM-driven tool selection:**
   Use an **agentic LLM controller** (LangGraph or Autogen) to dynamically select which tool(s) to deploy given the current regime (bull, bear, neutral, volatile).

3. **Performance and interpretability analysis:**
   Quantify not only returns but *why* certain tools were chosen by the LLM, creating transparent mappings between market states, algorithmic decisions, and outcomes.

4. **Comprehensive logging and reproducibility:**
   All data flows, decisions, and model calls will be fully logged and versioned (MLflow + TimescaleDB + vector store) to support research reproducibility and future extension.

## **4. Experimental Design**

1. **Dataset selection:**
   Use 10–20 years of equity & ETF data (daily & intraday granularity) to capture multiple market cycles.

2. **Regime labeling:**
   Segment history into regimes via volatility clustering (RS-GARCH/HMM) and validate with macro indicators (VIX, yield curve, GDP growth).

3. **Tool evaluation loop:**

   * For each time segment, run all applicable algorithms (classical & quantum).
   * Measure: Sharpe ratio, Sortino, drawdown, VaR/CVaR, hit ratio, volatility, stability.
   * Record which tool performs best under each regime.

4. **LLM-driven selection:**

   * The LLM agent receives recent market features + performance logs.
   * It chooses the next best combination of tools (risk + optimizer + predictor).
   * Log both *choice rationale* (LLM reasoning trace) and *resulting performance*.

5. **Comparative metrics:**
   Build a multi-dimensional table linking:
   $$
   (\text{Market Regime}) \rightarrow (\text{Tool Selection}) \rightarrow (\text{Performance Metrics})
   $$
   enabling analysis of tool–regime–LLM decision alignment.
